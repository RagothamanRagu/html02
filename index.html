        <p>"You'll be an expert in everything": This is a common misconception. While a full stack course aims to
            provide a
            broad understanding of both front-end and back-end development, becoming an expert in every technology
            covered
            in the course is unlikely. Mastery comes with experience and continued learning beyond the course.

            "Guaranteed high-paying job": While completing a full stack course may increase your chances of landing a
            job in
            web development, there are no guarantees of a high-paying position. Job prospects depend on various factors
            such
            as your skills, experience, the job market, and employer demand.</p>

        <p> While completing a full-stack course can certainly open up job opportunities, there are no guarantees of
            landing
            a high-paying job solely based on completing the course. Factors such as market demand, location, and your
            own
            skill level will also play significant roles in securing a well-paying position.</p>
